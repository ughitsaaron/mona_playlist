# Mona

A toy Elixir application to generate Spotify playlists from [the Mona show on WFMU](https://wfmu.org/playlists/M1).

## Requirements

Copy `sample.env` as `.env` and fill in the necessary credentials for authorizing the Spotify API

## To do
- [] Make Spotify authentication a separate concern (e.g., isolated module or application)
- [] Add a more robust CLI
